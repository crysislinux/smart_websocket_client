# Smart Websocket Client
Smart Websocket Client is a chrome extension to help developers develop and test websocket.

[Try it online](http://crysislinux.github.io/smart_websocket_client/)

# Why another websocket client
I checked websocket clients in chrome web store and I am using Simple Websocket Client. It is a great tool for testing. But it still lack some features. I hope that Smart Websocket Client will fill the gap.

# Features
* Rich text editor integration
* Remember history input like some web api testing tools(postman) does.

# Future Features
* Create fake messages for testing. This is useful if the backend is not ready yet but you want to develop your frontend code now(going to be implemented).
* Account system, you can share the messages to your team. 

# Install && Build

### Important

> npm install // install dependencies

You should run npm install first before the following operation. 

> npm run watch // you can open localhost:8080 to try it

> npm run build // generate build files in dist folder

> PRODUCTION=1 npm run build // build minified version of build files

> open http://localhost:8080

# Notice

This tool has not been pushed into Chrome App Store. I am trying to get the developer fee paid first. Not about money, but I cannot pay it easily in China.

You can load it to Chrome directly after building(a new folder called dist is generated).
